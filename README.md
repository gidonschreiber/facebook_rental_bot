# Facebook Rental Bot

A Python bot that monitors Facebook rental groups for apartments in the Rehavia area of Jerusalem, analyzes posts using OpenAI, and sends notifications to Telegram when matching apartments are found.

## Features
- Scrapes Facebook group posts using Playwright
- Uses OpenAI to analyze and filter posts based on strict criteria
